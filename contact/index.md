## In Person: 
I am stationed in the Signals and Information Processing Lab, on the 3rd floor of the EE Building (**Room 3.06** ), at the UWA Crawley Campus.
Make sure to send me an email before turning up. I'm usually somewhere on-campus during business hours, but often not in the lab.


## Email
Email is by far the most reliable way to contact me. Better than phone. [lyndon[dot]white[at]research[dot]uwa[dot]edu[dot]au](mailto:lyndon[dot]white[at]research[dot]uwa[dot]edu[dot]au)


## Twitter
[@oxinabox_frames](https://twitter.com/oxinabox_frames)

I mostly use twitter to complain to companies, and for technical discussions.

## LinkedIn
https://www.linkedin.com/in/lyndon-white-46b9a035/
I used LinkedIn only because it is uquitious, and it is better than letting any work stuff touch my personal social media (e.g. facebook).
But if I am not looking for a job, I may go years without openning it.
