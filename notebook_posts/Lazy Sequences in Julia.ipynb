    "The iterator is the tool uses to do this.\n",
    "Sometimes the terms are uses casually and interchangably.\n",
    "They exact implementation varies from language to language a surprising amount.\n",
    "Though the core idea remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In julia they are define by (perhaps the most formal of all) [informal interfaces](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/interfaces/#man-interface-iteration-1).\n",
    "In short iterators in julia are defined by a `start` function which takes an iterable,\n",
    "and gives back the initial state for an iterator upon it.\n",
    "a `next` function that takes an iterable and state and gives back the next value, and a new state,\n",
    "and a `done` function that takes the same and returns a boolean sayign if there iteratator is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also have Holy traits to define what eltype they return and how long they are.\n",
    "Not going to go in to this here, but I will note that specifying the `elype` is a feature  channels have that the 0.5 producer based code does not.\n",
    "and that 0.6 generators don't have either right now.\n",

    "Coroutines are the generalisation of Functions (subroutines),\n",
    "to have have multiple entry and exit points.\n",
    "In julia they are called Task.\n",
    "They are most notable for being used in the implementation of `@async` etc.\n",

    "they have the ability to yield up control to another coroutine;\n",
    "and when they get control passed back to them, they resume where they left off.\n",

    "Its worth noting that they are not threads.\n",
    "They do not themselves ever cause more than 1 thing to happen at a time on a computer.\n",
    "Though there are similarities in how they operate.\n",
