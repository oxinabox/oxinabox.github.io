Continuous delivery (CD) is a practice in software development of always having a deliverable product.
It means at any point in time someone can say give me the latest version, and you (the developer) can hand it over to them.

What does it mean to continously deliverable science?
A friend of mine's advisor (apparently) had the expectation that at any point in time he could call on any member of his lab to present on what they were doing, and that lab member would have a slideshow already prepared.
