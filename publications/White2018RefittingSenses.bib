  abstract  = {Word sense embeddings are vector representations of polysemous words -- words with multiple meanings.
These induced sense embeddings, however, do not necessarily correspond to any dictionary senses of the word.
This limits their applicability in traditional semantic-orientated tasks such as lexical word sense disambiguation.
To overcome this, we propose a method to find new sense embeddings of known meaning.
We term this method refitting, as the new embedding is fitted to model the meaning of a target word in the example sentence.
This is accomplished using the probabilities of the existing induced sense embeddings, as well as their vector values.
Our contributions are threefold:
(1) The refitting method to find the new sense embeddings;
 (2) a novel smoothing technique, for use with the refitting method;
and (3) a new similarity measure for words in context, defined by using the refitted sense embeddings.
We show how our techniques improve the performance of the Adaptive Skip-Gram sense embeddings for word similarly evaluation; and how they allow the embeddings to be used for lexical word sense disambiguation -- which was not possible using the induced sense embeddings.},
