## Novel Perspectives
[*[Web-App]*](np)   [*[Source]*](https://github.com/oxinabox/NovelPerspective)  
A tool for modifying (transforming) ebooks, based on the point of view character.
Epic fantasy novels are notable for their large cast of Point of View characters.
Sometimes you just don't care for some of them, or you want to read just a single characters story-line,
for example on a second read through.
NovelPerspectives uses machine learning to discover the main character of a chapter,
and transforms the book to include or exclude characters.
