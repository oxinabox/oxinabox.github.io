## A UWA Beamer Template

[Download Here](./uwabeamer.zip) 

This is a template for LaTeX [Beamer](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer).
Beamer is a LaTeX package  for slideshows.
UWA has [rules and tempates](http://www.brand.uwa.edu.au/) on use of its branding. However, those templates do not include one for beamer, thus this.

I personally don't use this anymore, as I think the border takes up too much screen real-estate.
I got for something far more minimalist and just stick the UWA logo on the title slide.
