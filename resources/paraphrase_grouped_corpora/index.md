title: Paraphrase Grouped Corpora

---

These corpora have been prepared by taking existing real-word based corpora: The Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus, and Opinosis, and partitioning them into  groups of sentences which all share the same meaning.

Use of either of these should cite the paper:

## Opinosis

[Download](./opinosis_paraphrase_grouped.zip)

A subset of the Opinosis corpus was manually grouped according to its meaning.

The original Opinosis corpus can be obtained by following [this link](http://kavita-ganesan.com/opinosis-opinion-dataset)

This derived corpus is redistributed by permission of the original corpus creator.

Use of the derived corpus here should cite the paper detailing the original corpus:

    }

## MSRP

[Download](./msrp_paraphrase_grouped.zip)

A subset of the Microsoft Research Paraphrase corpus was automatically grouped according to its original manually annotated meaning. This was done by taking the symetric and transitive closure over the original set of paraphrase pairs.

The original MSRP corpus can be obtained by following [this link](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/607d14d9-20cd-47e3-85bc-a2f65cd28042/)

This derived corpus is redistributed under the [MSR-SSLA](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/607d14d9-20cd-47e3-85bc-a2f65cd28042/License.txt).

Use of the derived corpus here should cite the paper detailing the original corpus:
